# FEICP
FEICP (Finding Exon-Intron circular RNAs from paired-end RNA-seq) is for EIciRNAs (Exon-Intron circular RNAs) detection from paired-end RNA-seq.

The whole FEICP pipeline has three main parts: 1. Detecting circular RNAs from RNA-seq using BWA and CIRI2; and 2. Getting those BSJs (back splicing reads) which can be mapped within introns; and 3. Va


## This pipeline aims to find the Exon-Intron circular RNAs (EIciRNAs) from paired-end RNA-seq and can be divided into 3 main steps
